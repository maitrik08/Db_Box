Project Definition: DB Box


Project Description:
The "DB Box" project is designed to help students learn how to perform CRUD (Create, Read,
Update, Delete) operations on a TODO list using the sqflite package in Flutter. The project also
includes advanced features like bookmarking or favoriting TODOs, which will be stored in local
storage using the shared_preferences package.
Additionally, students are required to implement a splash screen, a one-time introduction screen,
and a theme toggle functionality that maintains its state persistently across app sessions. The
project will follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to promote clean code architecture
and include state management through either Provider or GetX.
This project offers a comprehensive learning experience in building database-driven applications,
managing local storage, and incorporating important user interface elements such as splash
screens and themes. By the end of this project, students will be able to manage app state
efficiently, handle persistent data storage, and create intuitive user interfaces.


Project Features:
- Implement CRUD functionalities for TODOs using the sqflite package to store data in a local
SQLite database.
- Allow users to bookmark or favorite specific TODO items and store these in local storage using
shared_preferences.
- Implement a splash screen that displays when the app is launched.
- Add an introduction screen that appears only the first time the app is opened, using
shared_preferences to track this.
- Implement a light/dark theme toggle option that allows users to switch between themes, with
the selected theme state saved persistently using shared_preferences.
- Organize the project following the MVC architecture to maintain clear separation between the
Model, View, and Controller layers.
- Manage the app's state using either Provider or GetX for efficient state handling, particularly
for the TODO list and theme persistence.

Project Technologies:
- Dart language
- Flutter framework with MVC and Provider/GetX architecture
- Local storage: sqflite, and shared_preferences packages
Project Evaluation:
- Functionality: Correctness and completeness of the CRUD operations for TODOs.
- State Management: Proper implementation of state management using either Provider or
GetX, especially for the TODO list, theme toggle, and splash/intro screens.
- Persistent Data Storage: Effectiveness in storing and retrieving bookmarked TODOs and
theme preferences using shared_preferences.
- Architecture: Adherence to the MVC pattern and the separation of concerns in the code.
- User Interface: User-friendliness of the UI, including how the TODOs, bookmarks, and
themes are displayed.
- Additional Features: Implementation of the splash screen and one-time intro screen, as well as
the theme toggle with persistent state.
